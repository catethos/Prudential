General Data Science Workflow
==============================

![](images/process.png)

1. Problem statements
  - Decide the actual problme
  - Decide what data is needed
2. Data Collection
  - Design the data collection pipeline
  - Ensure the quality of data collected
3. Data Cleaning/Transformation
  - Transform the data into suitable format for analysis
4. Data Analysis
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
    - to get a feeling how the data look like
    - check for anomalies/pattern
    - visualisation
  - Baseline Modelling
    - Build a most simple model to explain the data
    - Any further complicated model should out perform this or else is useless
    - sense check
  - Model Building
    - Using suitable statistical/machine learning model in this stage to squeeze out the performance
    - Cross-validation
    - Select the best model
5. Result
  - Report/Dashboard
  - Visualisation
  - Automation


Data Points
===========
![](images/data.png)

The data points we are going to collect are divided into 2 major categories
1. Predictors - those we are using to predict job performance
2. Prediction - those that constitute job performance (what we want to measure ultimately)

The predictors are those we believe to influence job performance and reflect our view about holistic evauluation.
- Experience
- PICA
- Demography
- Social Status

The prediction shows our willingness to measure beyond sales number as a proxy of the job performance. We are also considering social interaction with peers and supervisors as a more holistic view of job performance.
